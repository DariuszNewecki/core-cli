# src/cli/resources/vectors/rebuild.py
"""`core-admin vectors rebuild` — rebuild a Qdrant collection from scratch.

Replaces the structurally-broken command removed in #201 (it called
delete_collection then logged fake "Recreated"/"Re-indexed" success with no
underlying work). A real rebuild is three coordinated operations (#203):

  1. Delete the Qdrant collection.
  2. Reset ``core.repo_artifacts.chunk_count = 0`` for the rows targeting that
     collection (skipping permanently-empty ``-1`` rows) so RepoEmbedderWorker
     re-selects them (its claim query is ``WHERE chunk_count = 0``).
  3. RepoEmbedderWorker repopulates organically on its next cycle — it
     ``ensure_collection``s on first upsert, so the collection is recreated
     with current vectors (e.g. after an embedding-model change).

Destructive: dry-run by default; ``--write`` applies.
